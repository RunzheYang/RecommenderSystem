# A Practical Comparison of Denoising Autoencoder and Factorization Machine for Recommending Movies
CS420 Coursework: Recommender System

## Abstract
In this coursework, the author implemented and compared two most successful models for Recommender System: Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) and Factorization Machine (FM). Although the DAE is a powerful unsupervised deep learning method to recover corrupted data, on the speciÔ¨Åc recommender system task it is still less powerful than traditional method such as the FM, because of the high sparsity of data and poor compatibility with side information.
